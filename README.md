# Adwaita-Compact
GNOME 3.16 themes set (for GTK3 and GNOME-Shell). Based on `Adwaita` but features more compact layout with reduced padding and smaller widget sizes to make `Adwaita` more suitable for not-so-big and not-so-hidpi screens.
Also contains good old blueish ticks & dots like the ones from GNOME 3.12.
